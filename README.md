## general comments

I moved most repeated functions in a single utility.c/utility.h library, changing the Makefile accordingly.

## Strassen

Code works, I had a few problems with optimized code, but they are solved. I modified correctness check to perform multiple checks between different matrices.
See legend in run file for details.

## Matrix chain multiplication

The code provided worked. I commented various functions to understand better the process, reformatted the output. For some reason, optimized solution does not scale linearly with N, for N>16. This could be explained by the code optimization itself.
